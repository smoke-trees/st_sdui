# stac_logger

A lightweight and reusable logging utility for the **st_sdui** framework. It switches between implementations — using Flutter's `debugPrint` on web/WASM platforms and a full-featured logger on native platforms — ensuring optimal performance and compatibility across all environments.

## Getting started

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  stac_logger: ^1.0.0
```

Then run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Usage

Import the package and use the `Log` class to log messages:

```dart
import 'package:stac_logger/stac_logger.dart';

void main() {
  // Log a debug message
  Log.d('Debug message');

  // Log an info message
  Log.i('Info message');

  // Log a warning message
  Log.w('Warning message');

  // Log an error message
  Log.e('Error message');
}
```

## Implementation Details

This package uses conditional imports to select the appropriate logging implementation based on the platform:

- On native platforms (iOS, Android, desktop), it uses a full-featured logger implementation.
- On web/WASM platforms, it uses a simplified implementation compatible with those environments.

The conditional import approach ensures that no `dart:io` code is included in web/WASM builds, making the package fully compatible with WebAssembly.

## Additional information

This package is part of the **st_sdui** framework ecosystem and is designed to provide logging functionality that works across all platforms, including WASM environments.
